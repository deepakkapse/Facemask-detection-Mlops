# Facemask-detection-Mlops
1. Project Title: Face Mask detection using deeplearning

<br>
2. Problem Statement:
<br>
   India has been fighting the pandemic with great spirit, with unlocking phases being in motion. It is quite difficult to monitor social distancing in public places, especially in countries with a large population. There is no way to completely ensure that the masses wear their masks properly at times when they go out in public. Even if a single business or workplace ignores these norms, the situation might get back to where it started. The need to be proactive now is more than ever, Governments all around the world recognized the power of AI and ML in order to fight the pandemic. Since wearing a mask and avoiding crowded places is the only alternative until the vaccine is introduced, Computer vision in the form of mask detection can be a reviving factor to get life back to normal. Mask Detection models ensuring the efficient use of masks at workplaces and public areas. Real-time mask detection can solve the monitoring issues in countries with large populations

3. Technologies Used :
<br>

Opencv: OpenCV is the huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. It is used to capture the image and use them for training model, used for detection. It is also used to capture real-time video capture for face mask detection in the project.
<br>
Tensorflow/Keras: loading our face mask detection dataset from disk and training a model to create the CNN that classifies the images as with or without a mask.
<br>

Streamlit: Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science. Here we have used to build and deploy our model in the website and used for interaction with the user.

<br>
Os Module: We have used a module to run our python files automatically behind the website 
<br>
Transfer learning: this was made for reuse of a pre-trained weight and bias of data

<br>
Imagenet: Loading the MobilNetV2 classifier (we used for  fine-tune this model with pre-trained ImageNet weights

4. Conclusion :<br>
COVID19  is the greatest humanitarian challenge facing the world ever since World War II. With over 45,000 fresh cases, the COVID-19 in India rose to 90 lakhs with 1,32,162 fatalities. Without expecting such an issue, we needed to face 100 million people losing their jobs in India. Global lockdown and quarantine took a troll on mental health. In order to revive the economies, the businesses and workplaces must open the proper functioning. Safety measures must be enforced to ensure the safety of the general public. The two most important measures are social distancing and mask culture.
<br>
5. Future Scope :<br>
Every year around 7 million people die due to exposure to the air population. The mask can reduce at least 1% of the population dying from air pollution. To make this possible, We can use mask detection for labors working in the region of higher air pollution like lead other metal industries, Traffic policers, and other places too. These detection models can be improved to solve the above-mentioned issues.
